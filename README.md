# Recording_system
Overview This project consists of two main components:  Client (client.py) â€“ Captures keystrokes, records screen, webcam, and audio, and uploads the recorded files to a Flask server at regular intervals. Flask Server (app.py) â€“ Hosts an upload endpoint to receive and store files sent by the client, allowing downloads of recorded content.<br>


âš  Disclaimer: This is proof-of-concept code and is likely to be buggy and unstable. It is strictly for educational purposes only and should not be used for unauthorized monitoring or data collection.

ðŸ›  Features<br>
Client (client.py):<br>
Records keystrokes, screen activity, webcam footage, and audio.<br>
Automatically uploads recorded files to a Flask server every 178 seconds.<br>
Deletes old recordings to manage storage.<br>
Runs in the background and auto-restarts after each recording session.<br>
Server (app.py):<br>
Hosts an upload endpoint to receive files.<br>
Stores uploaded recordings in the /uploads directory.<br>
Provides a web interface to view uploaded files.<br>
Allows downloading of stored files.<br>

# Usage Instructions
Client (client.py)<br>
Modify FLASK_SERVER_URL in client.py to point to your serverâ€™s IP address if running remotely.<br>
Run client.py on the machine you want to record from.<br>
The client will automatically record and upload data every 178 seconds.<br>

Server (app.py)<br>
Run app.py on the server machine.<br>
Ensure the /uploads directory exists and is writable.<br>
Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in a browser to view uploaded files.<br>
# Setting Up the templates Folder and index.html File<br>
The Flask server (app.py) renders an HTML page to display uploaded files. Flask expects HTML templates to be stored inside a templates/ folder.<br>
<b>How the index.html File Works</b><br>
Displays a list of uploaded files with their names, upload timestamps, and the IP address of the client that uploaded them.<br>
Provides a "Download" link for each file, allowing users to download files directly from the server.<br>
Uses Flask's url_for('download_file', filename=file[0]) to dynamically generate download links.<br>
# How the Programs Work<br>
Client (client.py)<br>
Keylogger: Captures keystrokes and writes them to a text file.<br>
Screen Recorder: Takes continuous screenshots and saves them as a video file.<br>
Webcam Recorder: Captures footage from the webcam and saves it as a video file.<br>
Audio Recorder: Records microphone input and saves it as a .wav file.<br>
File Uploader: Sends recorded files to the Flask server every 178 seconds.<br>
File Cleaner: Deletes old files to free up storage space.<br>
Auto-Restart Mechanism: Restarts the client process after every recording session to ensure continued operation.<br>

Server (app.py)<br>
Receives uploaded files from the client via an HTTP POST request.<br>
Stores files in the /uploads directory.<br>
Displays uploaded files in a web interface.<br>
Allows file downloads via a /download/<filename> endpoint.<br>
